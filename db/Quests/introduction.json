At first, she wanted only to return home, but instead of finding a way back, she learned how to hide. A black cloak conceals her unnaturally white mane, and she found joy in gathering all kinds of ammunition and even creating a new types. In time, she even found a trusted partner: you.\n\nNow, after all the experience she has gained, Amonya has chosen to stay. She intends to take revenge on those who crossed her path and made her struggle in this land. This quiet pony values her beloved piles of ammunition, yet her hatred for her enemies runs even deeper. Eliminate them, bring her items useful to her life, and she will reward you with her ammo reserves. Amonya may even share experimental variants of ammunition that could aid you in your escape from Tarkov.",
